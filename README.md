## How the Game Works
Try to guess the hidden spell based on the characteristics of other spells.

1. Start the game by guessing a spell based on no information; this is the starting point. There is also a `Random Start` button to randomize the first guess if desired.
2. From here, we get our first information, and below is the legend for each image we may see.
3. Continue making guesses until the hidden spell has been found.

## Which Spells Are in the Game?
For the most part, **only hitting spells** from 1 pip to Empyrea spells are in the game. The Scions are the final spells currently in this game. Every school has 1-11 pip spells, and 3 shadow spells - Darkmoor, Polaris, and Mirage.<br />
**Life has both 1-4 pip hitting and healing spells in the game.**

PvP spells will most likely never be in the game. The spells are default spells, no hit and bubbles, no newer additions such as Inferno Salamander and Earth Walker

There may be future versions of Wizardle where there are game modes with specific spells or even custom game modes with spells the players can decide.

## Further Explanations  of Characteristics

### Pip Cost
X pip spells are considered worth 14 pips, as they always have the highest pip cost potential.<br />
As of now, Tempest, Heck Hound, Judgement, Dryad, and Snowball Barrage are the only X pip spells in the game.

### Uses Shadow
This category tends to be the most confusing, but it is very simple once it's understood.<br />
Mostly, think of it as 'do these match?' Here are all possible outcomes to show clearly how it works:

| Hidden Spell       | Guessed Spell      | Matches       |
|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|
| Uses Shadow        | Uses Shadow        | ✅            |
| Uses Shadow        | Doesn't Use Shadow | ❌            |
| Doesn't Use Shadow | Uses Shadow        | ❌            |
| Doesn't Use Shadow | Doesn't Use Shadow | ✅            |

### Arc Obtained
The first 3 arcs are in this game.
* Arc 1: 1-7 pip spells
* Arc 2: 8-10 pip and Darkmoor spells
* Arc 3: Polaris and Mirage shadow spells, then Empyrea spells (the Scions)
